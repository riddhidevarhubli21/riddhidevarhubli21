👋 Hi, I’m Riddhi

I’m a Computer Science and Data Science student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (Class of 2027) with a strong interest in systems, data-driven decision making, and building products that scale.

I enjoy working close to the metal—debugging C programs, reasoning about memory, caching, and performance—as much as I enjoy extracting insight from data. I’ve built systems-level projects like a Unix-style shell using Linux system calls and inter-process communication, and I’ve also worked on applied AI and ML projects that use large, messy datasets to power real-world tools.

I was selected for the Summer of AI Lab (SAIL), where my team built Find My Fit, a multimodal AI fashion traceback tool that analyzes images and text to recommend affordable, lower-impact alternatives. The project won the program and was presented to OpenAI’s VP of Engineering and Applied Infrastructure. I’m especially interested in making AI systems more accurate, reliable, and useful for real users.

Currently, I’m a Peer Mentor for Machine Organization, where I help students understand C, pointers, memory management, caching, and low-level debugging. I enjoy breaking down complex systems concepts and thinking deeply about how software behaves under real constraints.
